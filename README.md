# [Insert Working Title Here]
This is a WIP rom hack of Pokémon Crystal.

While this is still very much a work in progress, I have several ideas for this hack that I want to implement:
- Set in the Orange Archipelago.
- Must be able to run on real hardware with good (30 fps minimum) performance.
- A large, fully open world. Not just a bunch of different maps connected together, but a single cohesive world.
- No loading zones or multiple maps or other hackery. The world should load dynamically around the player for a truly seamless experience.
- Everything should feel realistically scaled. No "towns" that consist of two houses and a Pokémon lab, no buildings that are bigger on the inside.
- Pokémon levels for gyms and most overworld areas should scale with progress while leaving the same relative challenge difference between areas.
- Lots of quality of life changes, especially when it comes to movement and battling.
- It should still feel like Crystal, just with a large open world and some modern conveniences.

## Installation
If you wish to buld this hack for yourself, clone this repository and follow the documentation for the <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal">pokecrystal</a> project that this hack is based on. 

This repository is currently set up to use a local copy of RGBDS. If you wish to use a system-wide installation, delete the rgbds folder and tell Make to use the system-wide installation of RGBDS.
