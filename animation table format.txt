Tables store a 16 bit frame ID and 16 bit tile pointer, with the top two bits of the pointer being bank bits
Frame id $FFFF signals end of table, the pointer to follow is the start of the table
Since the first frame ID is always $0000, it is instead used as the modulus for the table
The last animation frame always lasts for only 1 frame, so it may need to be duplicated
