chunk header struct
0x0-0x1: charblock bank
0x2-0x3: charblock pointer within bank (top two bits specify bit depth [%11 = 8. %10 = 4, %01 = 2, %00 = 1])
0x4-0x5: blockset pointer (top two bits may specify blockset bank)
0x6: Blockset size

Blockset
0x0 - 0x8: Packed tile ids
0x9 - 0xB: Collision bytes (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right)
0xC - 0xF: Packed top two bits of tile attributes (priority flag & vertical flip). they are stored as (3210 7654 BA98 FEDC) where each number is a bit pair for a tile
0x10 - 0x2F: Packed tile ids (12 bit) and remaining bits of attributes

Replacement Strategy:
Tiles are dealt with via refrence counting from the loaded charblocks. If they ever reach 0 refrences, they are eligible to be replaced.
Charblocks themselves will have dedicated bits for each chunk quadrant. If all the bits are cleared, the charblock is eligible for replacement.
This algorithm will likely prioritize simplicity over pure efficiency. It will, however, need to be designed to run in stages over multiple frames.
Tiles or charblocks that become unreferenced won't get zeroed, they will simply be overwritten when a new piece of data needs a home.
